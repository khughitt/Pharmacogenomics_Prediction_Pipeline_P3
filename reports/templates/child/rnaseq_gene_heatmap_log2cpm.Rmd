### Log2-CPM counts (low-count filtered)

```{r rnaseq_gene_heatmap, echo=FALSE}
# filter out low-count genes 
log2cpm_counts_filtered <- filter_low_counts(log2cpm_counts)

# sub-sample data
ind <- sample(1:nrow(log2cpm_counts_filtered), min(2000, nrow(log2cpm_counts_filtered)))
heatmap.2(log2cpm_counts_filtered[ind,], trace='none', labRow=FALSE,
          col=redgreen(75))
```
