### Counts (low-count filtered)

```{r rnaseq_gene_heatmap, echo=FALSE}
# filter out low-count genes 
counts_filtered <- filter_low_counts(mat)

# sub-sample data
ind <- sample(1:nrow(counts_filtered), min(2000, nrow(counts_filtered)))
heatmap.2(counts_filtered[ind,], trace='none', labRow=FALSE,
          col=redgreen(75))
```
